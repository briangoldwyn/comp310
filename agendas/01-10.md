Gradle needs to be on your path (but Chocolately idiotically did not do that for us).

1. Windows users: add this to your path. Select everything below and copy to the clipboard.

    ;C:\Chocolatey\lib\gradle.1.8.0\tools\gradle-1.8\bin

2. Go to Computer -> System Settings -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment variables...
3. Under System variables, look for *Path* and click Edit...
4. Push the right arrow key to go to the end and press Ctrl V to paste the above in. Click OK. OK. OK.
